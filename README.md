# 🧪 Data Science Lab

> **Continuous Learning & Experimental Sandbox**

Welcome to my central hub for technical growth. This repository documents my daily coding practices, algorithm drills, and experiments with new libraries and tools. It serves as a playground to benchmark solutions and refine my problem-solving skills outside of production-level projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The content is organized into specific domains to maintain modularity:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`/leetcode_solutions`](./leetcode_solutions)** | **Algorithmic Logic:** Optimized solutions for LeetCode/HackerRank problems. Focus on time/space complexity and clean code. |
| **[`/ds_experiments`](./ds_experiments)** | **Data Manipulation:** Short-form analysis, cleaning challenges, and tests with libraries like Pandas, Polars, or Scikit-learn. |
| **[`/python_scripts`](./python_scripts)** | **Automation & Utilities:** Standalone Python scripts for task automation, web scraping, or helper functions. |

## 🚀 Objective
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **consistency** and **adaptability**, keeping a record of my evolving coding standards and technical exploration.
